# TEAM 4 Final Project
This is Spring 2017, ECE 4574, Team 4's final project submission. 

Our group created an anonymous messaging app in Android called 'mECEge' that allows users to comment in specific class threads. It is comprised of a user friendly Android application, Analytics server, front-end server interface, and back-end storage database.
